## User Dashboard (Main App Functionality)

### Purpose

- Provide a space for users to interact with APIs via the app.
- Show user-specific data (e.g., API call logs, subscriptions).

### Features

- Input form for API endpoint and parameters.
- Chat-like interface powered by an LLM.
- Error handling with user-friendly explanations.
- Tiered features (e.g., free vs. premium).

### Implementation

#### Create Dashboard Layout

- Use a Shadcn sidebar for navigation (e.g., Home, Profile, Settings).
- Main content area for interacting with APIs.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

#### Develop API Interaction Feature

- **Input Form**: Allow users to enter API endpoints and parameters.
- **Chat Interface**:
  - Use a WebSocket or REST-based architecture for real-time communication.
  - Render LLM responses in a chat format using Shadcnâ€™s message components.
- **Handle User Data**:
  - Store API call logs and preferences in Supabase.
  - Use role-based access control to unlock premium features for subscribed users.
- **Error Management**:
  - Implement middleware for handling errors from APIs.
  - Display errors in a user-friendly way with actionable guidance.
- **Integrate Subscription System**:
  - Use Stripe for managing payments.
  - Create a webhook to update user roles in Supabase based on payment status.

#### API Management

- **Authentication**:
  - Support OAuth 2.0 for secure API access.
  - Store API credentials securely using environment variables.
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Implement exponential backoff strategies for handling rate limits.
  - Notify users when rate limits are reached and suggest alternatives.

#### LLM Integration

- **Service Selection**: Use OpenAI's GPT-4 for conversational capabilities.
- **Integration Steps**:
  - Obtain API keys from OpenAI and store them securely.
  - Create a service layer to interact with the LLM API.
  - Handle API responses and manage token usage efficiently.

#### Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles**:
  - **Free Users**: Limited number of API calls per month, access to basic features.
  - **Premium Users**: Unlimited API calls, access to advanced features like detailed analytics and priority support.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use middleware to check user roles before granting access to premium routes.
  - Update user roles based on subscription status via Stripe webhooks.

#### Testing

- Test API interactions with mock endpoints.
- Ensure proper role-based feature access.
