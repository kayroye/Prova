## Login/Sign Up via NextAuth

### Purpose

- Provide secure access for users.
- Support multiple OAuth providers and email-based signup.

### Features

- Social login options (Google, GitHub).
- Email/password authentication.

### Security Measures

- **Password Strength**: Enforce a minimum length of 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - Implement MFA using authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator).
  - Provide backup codes for account recovery.

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Error Handling**:
  - Display specific error messages for failed login attempts (e.g., "Incorrect password," "User not found").
  - Implement retry mechanisms after multiple failed attempts.
- **Password Recovery**:
  - Enable users to request a password reset via email.
  - Send confirmation emails upon successful registration and password changes.
- **Persistent Session Management**: Ensure sessions persist across page reloads.

### Implementation

#### Set Up NextAuth

1. **Install NextAuth**: 
    ```bash
    npm install next-auth
    ```
2. **Create API Routes** in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`.
3. **Configure Providers** in NextAuth options:
    - Google, GitHub, etc.
4. **Connect to Supabase for User Data**:
    - Use Supabase for storing user data (e.g., subscription status).
    - Set up Supabase project and connect it to NextAuth with a custom adapter.

#### Frontend for Authentication

- Use Shadcn components for the login/signup UI.
- Implement the `useSession` hook from NextAuth to check the authentication state and conditionally render content.

#### Testing

- Test OAuth flows locally with dummy credentials.
- Ensure session persistence across page reloads.
- Include unit tests for authentication flows.
- Detail integration tests for end-to-end authentication scenarios.
