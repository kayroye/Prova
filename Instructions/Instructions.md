# Comprehensive Plan for the Application

## Overview of the App

The application is a tool that allows users to interact with public APIs via a conversational interface powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). Users can input API endpoints, and the app facilitates conversations with the API, including running tests and handling errors. The app supports a tiered model, where free users get basic features, and paid users unlock advanced functionalities.

## Login/Sign Up via NextAuth

### Purpose

- Provide secure access for users.
- Support multiple OAuth providers and email-based signup.

### Features

- Social login options (Google, GitHub).
- Email/password authentication.

### Security Measures

- **Password Strength**: Enforce a minimum length of 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - Implement MFA using authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator).
  - Provide backup codes for account recovery.

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Error Handling**:
  - Display specific error messages for failed login attempts (e.g., "Incorrect password," "User not found").
  - Implement retry mechanisms after multiple failed attempts.
- **Password Recovery**:
  - Enable users to request a password reset via email.
  - Send confirmation emails upon successful registration and password changes.
- **Persistent Session Management**: Ensure sessions persist across page reloads.

### Implementation

#### Set Up NextAuth

1. **Install NextAuth**: 
    ```bash
    npm install next-auth
    ```
2. **Create API Routes** in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`.
3. **Configure Providers** in NextAuth options:
    - Google, GitHub, etc.
4. **Connect to Supabase for User Data**:
    - Use Supabase for storing user data (e.g., subscription status).
    - Set up Supabase project and connect it to NextAuth with a custom adapter.

#### Frontend for Authentication

- Use Shadcn components for the login/signup UI.
- Implement the `useSession` hook from NextAuth to check the authentication state and conditionally render content.

#### Testing

- Test OAuth flows locally with dummy credentials.
- Ensure session persistence across page reloads.
- Include unit tests for authentication flows.
- Detail integration tests for end-to-end authentication scenarios.

### Features

- Input form for API endpoint and parameters.
- Chat-like interface powered by an LLM.
- Error handling with user-friendly explanations.
- Tiered features (e.g., free vs. premium).

### Implementation

#### Create Dashboard Layout

- Use a Shadcn sidebar for navigation (e.g., Home, Profile, Settings).
- Main content area for interacting with APIs.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

#### Develop API Interaction Feature

- **Input Form**: Allow users to enter API endpoints and parameters.
- **Chat Interface**:
  - Use a WebSocket or REST-based architecture for real-time communication.
  - Render LLM responses in a chat format using Shadcn’s message components.
- **Handle User Data**:
  - Store API call logs and preferences in Supabase.
  - Use role-based access control to unlock premium features for subscribed users.
- **Error Management**:
  - Implement middleware for handling errors from APIs.
  - Display errors in a user-friendly way with actionable guidance.
- **Integrate Subscription System**:
  - Use Stripe for managing payments.
  - Create a webhook to update user roles in Supabase based on payment status.

#### API Management

- **Authentication**:
  - Support OAuth 2.0 for secure API access.
  - Store API credentials securely using environment variables.
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Implement exponential backoff strategies for handling rate limits.
  - Notify users when rate limits are reached and suggest alternatives.

#### LLM Integration

- **Service Selection**: Use OpenAI's GPT-4 for conversational capabilities.
- **Integration Steps**:
  - Obtain API keys from OpenAI and store them securely.
  - Create a service layer to interact with the LLM API.
  - Handle API responses and manage token usage efficiently.

#### Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles**:
  - **Free Users**: Limited number of API calls per month, access to basic features.
  - **Premium Users**: Unlimited API calls, access to advanced features like detailed analytics and priority support.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use middleware to check user roles before granting access to premium routes.
  - Update user roles based on subscription status via Stripe webhooks.
